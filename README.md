# NBA-Map

The data that populates each popup is read in from the data_2.js file. It is preloaded for presentation purposes. 

To show the codeâ€™s true functionality and to begin with a blank map, delete that file, refresh your browser and click the star button. This will loop through all 30 teams in a single window and scrape the data. It will also write the data to a new data_2.js file. Once complete, logos and popup data will automatically be added to the map.
